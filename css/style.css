/* Step #1
Animate the logo with keyframes. It should start at a width of 25px and grow to 475px.  It should also start with an opacity of 0 and end with an opacity of 1. The animation should take 5 seconds and only happen when the page is loaded. */

/* Step #2
Edit the body element to use the Poppins font (using Google fonts) with serif as a backup.  It should also use the image ‚Äúconcrete_seamless.png‚Äù as a background-image with a backup color of #f1f1f1. Ensure you have quotation marks around the font, since it's a Google font!*/

Edit the css for the nav_links class to use flex to match our example. Do not modify the list items or the links - modify the nav_links class to use flex. Style to match the given example with additions like flex-direction, align-items, etc. */

.nav_links{
    display: flex;

Style the links so that they have the same color even after they have been visited. They will all be the color blue even after they have been visited, and doing so using the a selector with several psuedo-classes. */

/* Step #6
Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  The required styling is the following: a background using color #288088, a solid 2px border using #45ADAD, 20px of padding on the top and the bottom, and lastly, 50px border-radius on the top left and right corners. */

/* Step #7
Edit the css for the card class to match our example. Achieve this by using a flex-property to specify an initial ‚Äúsize‚Äù of 450px.  You need to think about this from a ‚Äúflex‚Äù perspective and realize that flex-direction will affect the size of the elements.  You can see that in the mobile view they all have the same width.  */
